\section{User Interface Design}
\label{section:user-interface-design}

The user interface for the multi-camera tracking system is designed to offer a clear, intuitive, and efficient experience for security personnel, facility managers, and other stakeholders, focusing on retrospective analysis of recorded video feeds.  The interface prioritizes the visualization of movement patterns, easy access to detailed tracking information.

\clearpage

The user interface presents an intuitive flow across multiple views as illustrated in the mockups. The Landing Page (Figure \ref{fig:mockup-landing-page}) offers users a choice between campus and factory views, followed by a date selection interface (Figure \ref{fig:mockup-landing-page-datetime}) to access specific video feed timeframes. Once a selection is made, the Group View Page (Figure \ref{fig:mockup-group-view}) displays all cameras with detected individuals, presenting a comprehensive map that visualizes tracking paths and shows detection counts per camera. This page features multiple tabs, including an overview tab showing all camera feeds simultaneously and individual tabs for specific views. For more detailed analysis, the Expanded Group View (Figure \ref{fig:mockup-group-view-expanded}) displays camera feeds with identification markers for each detected person, listing cropped images of all detected individuals below the video feed. Users can select specific individuals to focus tracking exclusively on them, viewing detailed information such as position tracking status, coordinates, confidence levels, timestamps, first detection time, current tracking duration, and movement analysis.

\section{Target and Development System}
\label{section:development-system}

This section outlines the technical requirements for the development and operation of our multi-camera tracking system, focusing on the capabilities needed to support the user stories and use cases identified earlier.

\subsection{Data Handling and Input Capabilities}
\label{subsection:data-handling-input}
To effectively analyze the multi-camera tracking scenarios, the system must process recorded video data from the MTMMC dataset (\ref{subsection:dataset-information}). Key requirements include:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=80pt]
    \item \textbf{Scalable Data Storage Access:} The system must interface with storage solutions capable of holding significant volumes of video data. It requires efficient access mechanisms to retrieve data based on time ranges and camera identifiers, ensuring recorded footage is readily available for retrospective analysis.
    \item \textbf{Historical Data Processing:} The system needs to process recorded video feeds from multiple cameras, potentially spanning different time periods. This capability is essential for batch analysis of past events and movement patterns.
    \item \textbf{Flexible Data Source Configuration:} The system needs a configuration-driven mechanism to specify the location of the input data sources, select specific scenarios or time windows for analysis, and identify the relevant cameras.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Core Tracking and Analysis Engine Requirements}
\label{subsection:core-tracking-analysis}
The central function of our multi-camera tracking system relies on sophisticated algorithms capable of tracking individuals across multiple camera views. This necessitates several core analytical capabilities:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=80pt]
    \item \textbf{Robust Person Detection:} The system requires the ability to accurately detect individuals within diverse single-camera views, handling variations in appearance, lighting, and partial occlusions typical in campus or factory environments (\ref{section:background}).
    \item \textbf{Intra-Camera Tracking Consistency:} Capability to maintain stable tracking of individuals within the field of view of a single camera over consecutive frames, assigning temporary identifiers.
    \item \textbf{Cross-Camera Re-Identification Logic:} A fundamental requirement is the implementation of logic to associate and match individuals across non-overlapping camera views (\ref{section:problem-statement}). This involves comparing extracted appearance features to maintain a persistent identity even with temporal gaps or changes in perspective.
    \item \textbf{Unified Coordinate System Transformation:} The system must be capable of transforming detected locations from individual camera image planes into a common spatial reference frame (e.g., a top-down map). This is essential for visualizing continuous movement paths across the entire monitored environment (\ref{subsection:main-features}).
    \item \textbf{Efficient State and Trajectory Management:} Requires mechanisms for managing the state of numerous tracked individuals (current location, persistent ID, last seen time/camera) and for storing historical trajectory data. This includes both data structures for processing and persistent storage for historical analysis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Interface and Visualization Needs}
\label{subsection:user-interface-visualization}
To deliver actionable insights to users like security officers and facility managers (\ref{section:target-user}), the system must provide an intuitive interface focused on effective visualization of tracking data:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=80pt]
    \item \textbf{Multi-Feed Presentation:} The user interface must be designed to display multiple camera feeds concurrently, allowing operators to monitor different areas simultaneously.
    \item \textbf{Integrated Data Overlay:} Requires the capability to overlay tracking information (such as bounding boxes, persistent IDs, status indicators) directly onto the corresponding camera feeds in a clear and understandable manner.
    \item \textbf{Spatial Map Display:} A core requirement is the visualization of movement on a unified map (\ref{subsection:main-features}). The interface must display current positions and historical paths of tracked individuals on this map to provide a comprehensive view of movement patterns.
    \item \textbf{Time-Based Navigation:} Users need the ability to select specific time periods for review and analysis, with controls to navigate through the recorded footage across multiple cameras simultaneously.
    \item \textbf{Responsive Display Framework:} The frontend component must be built using technologies that support efficient rendering of tracking data and provide a clear presentation suitable for monitoring and analysis tasks.
\end{itemize}
